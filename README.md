# Adaptive-Noise-Canceling
Noise removal with a LMS filter in MATLAB

Place the original audio signal as "original.wav", the noise signal as "noise.wav" and reference signal as "ref.wav" in the working directoy of MATLAM. Running ethe script creates "enhanced.wav" with the application of Least Mean Square Adaptive Filtering. You can adjust the noise gain to desirable mix in the script.
